Sources tab => Briefly describe what you see in files with names starting with hn.js and news.css. How are these files different? What is their purpose?  <br/>
Response: In the files starting with news.css i see all the media like text and images written in the HTML language and in the files starting with hn.js i see all the operations you can do in the website like functions with a code similar to Python.
          The difference between then is the way is structured and their function for the website because one is like a code of Python with functions and the other one is like the main aspects of the appearance.
